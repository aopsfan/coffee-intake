This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Rendering House wants to hire you!!!

Watch the short clip `Sample.mp4`. That is your target working app. But in this repo, the code is not where it needs to be. There are bugs. The implementation also falls short. Fix this app and get it work like what is shown in the video clip.

Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/RenderingHouse/coffee-intake.git
```

If you don't have `yarn`, install it from here:
https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install


next, run
```
yarn install
```

run the following to get started
```
yarn start
```

**Bonus Points**
* Once you get the app up and running, there are 3 buttons for you to increment the number of cups Expresso, Latte, or Machiato that you drink daily. Change the UI so that you can both increment, and decrement the counter for each type of coffee that you drink.
